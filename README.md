Given an input, find out whether the input can be segmented into a sequence of valid words from the dictionary.
A valid word is at least two character long.

Assume words are available in a dictionary.

Input: welikemobile

Output: true

The input can be separted as "we like mobile"

Input: abcdefg

Output: false

The input cannot be separated by any valid words.

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as input of differing character length, memory and performance considerations for the project.
